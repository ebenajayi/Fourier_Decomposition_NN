# Fourier_Decomposition_NN
1
The purpose of this project is to generate a neural network capable of performing a Fourier Decomposition of an arbitrary periodic waveform. The Fourier analysis, of course, is intended to break a periodic waveform into its basic harmonics. So, the waveform is defined by a series of points over a cycle of a fundamental (or, from symmetry, over a quarter or a half of the waveform). For this assignment, assumption that all the harmonics are in phase was made and the dc level was removed, hence, the waveform is expressed by a set of harmonics. To achieve the goal of this assignment, Tensorflow was used and the following steps were taken:
